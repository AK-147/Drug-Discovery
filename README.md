  <h2>:book: Description</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>:reminder_ribbon: An app built via Streamlit to determine the effectiveness of drugs against an enzyme linked to breast cancer.</li>
    <li>:test_tube: Uses a machine learning regression model trained on 2500+ compounds via pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.</li>
    <li>:books: Created as a personal project to delve into and explore the applications in drug discovery and bioinformatics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>:file_folder: Contents</h2>
  <p>There are two main folders containing the relevant files:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/AK-147/Drug-Discovery/tree/main/Notebooks">Notebooks</a></strong> contains the data preprocessing, analysis, and the final model as Python notebook files (<strong>.ipynb</strong>).</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/AK-147/Drug-Discovery/tree/main/Packages">Packages</a></strong> holds files critical to the PaDEL-Descriptor software used for essential computations in the final dataset.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Google Colab</strong> was the main environment used to develop the model.</p>
  
  <h2>:warning: Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>
    The application portion of the project is still in progress and will be completed soon.
